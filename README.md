# Impact Ejecta Transfer in the TRAPPIST-1 System
Investigating impact ejecta transfer in the TRAPPIST-1 system through N-body integration simulations, with Dr. Caleb Scharf at Columbia University.  
This code makes heavy use of [Hanno Rein's REBOUND N-body integration package](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound). 

## Method
We simulated the TRAPPIST-1 system and generate impact ejecta at the surface of planet d. Ejecta were given initial velocities of v_i = v_escape + v_increment, with v_escape = 7.856 km/s and v_increment = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5] km/s. The MERCURIUS integrator accurately simulates massless test particles without affecting planetary motion, so simulations can be aggregated. For each v_increment, we ran 60 simulations of 5,000 ejecta each for 2,000 years.   
**In total, each v_increment simulation has 300,000 ejecta integrated over 2,000 years.**   
<br>
To test for interstellar leakage, we additionally ran 200 simulations of 5,000 ejecta each (total 1 million ejecta) for 20,000 years, with v_inc = km/s.  
Simulations were performed in batches using Columbia University's terremoto computing cluster and the slurm job scheduling system.

## Results
Ejecta transfer simulations confirmed that the TRAPPIST-1 system supports very high-efficiency ejecta transfer, with 91-96% of all ejecta result in impact and 75% of those impacts occurring within the first 600 years.  
Interstellar leakage simulations showed that around 0.1% of total ejecta will eventually leak out of the system.

## Overview
- **sim_templates/** contains python and slurm templates for running simulations.
- **used_scripts/** contains the python and slurm scripts for specific v_increments.
- **analysis_tools/** contains modules for processing and analyzing output data.

## Documentation
[IN PROGRESS] - This code will be eventually generalized to create an end-to-end pipeline for simulating, processing, and analyzing impact ejecta in any exoplanetary system.  

### Simulation
1. Copy start_template.py and rename it to [#ejecta]e_[#years]y_[#velocity increment]vinc.py 
2. Edit lines 309-xxx to input simulation variables
3. copy start_template.sh and rename it the same way (with .sh)
4. Edit the .sh file to reflect the python file name, and how many iterations you want to run
5. Submit job to slurm  
  
A folder called `Ejecta_Simulation_Data` will be created, with the data from each simulation inside.   
  
### Analysis (see README inside analysis_tools for more info on creating specific plots)
1. Download the folder `analysis_tools` and add it to your PYTHONPATH.
2. Run `setup` from `setup.py` in the same directory as `Ejecta_Simulation_Data` to create a `Plots` directory structure.
3. Run `histograms` from `histograms.py` to create histograms.
4. Run `cols_v_time` from `cols_v_time.py` to create plots of collisions vs. time. 
5. For orbital element plots:
      - Run `sort_particles_all` from `orbital_elements.py`; this will create a .pkl file of sorted particles
      - Run `get_orbital_elements_all` from `orbital_elements.py`; this will create .pkl files of desired orbital elements
      - Run `orbital_elements_videos_all` from `orbital_elements.py` to create inc vs. a and e vs. a videos.
      - Run `ecc_snapshot_all` or `inc_snapshot_all` from `orbital_elements.py` to create specific time snapshots of inc vs. a or e vs. a graphs. (See README in analysis_tools for more details.)
